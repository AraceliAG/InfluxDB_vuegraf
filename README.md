This is a fork of vuegraf from jertel - https://github.com/jertel/vuegraf

Goal to add additional features to either be reveiwed/approved and merged back into jertel's code or remain a seperate product.

Additional Features
- [X] Reset config json file values to allow multiple runs without reseting database.
-     [X] Database reset
-     [X} History Days
- [ ] Add additional scales to the pull allowing to get years of history since minutes/second have a short life at emporia.
<br>    This also allows faster dashboards for creating itmes like daily or monthly graphs. 
-     [ ] Hours
-     [ ] Days
-     [ ] Months
- *Note while adding additional scales will keep seconds = true and minutes = false to not impact existing reporting.
-   But add additonal tags for sec/min/hour/day/month
